    # YOUR AGENTIC AI LOGIC GOES HERE
    # 1. Decompose the natural language query using LangChain.
    # 2. Call functions from core/engine.py to get recommendations.
    # 3. Interact with database/db_adapter.py for user history.
    # 4. Produce results back to a 'search-results' Kafka topic
    #    or store them in a cache (like Redis) for the API to pick up.
